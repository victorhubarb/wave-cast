## Project Description
Wavecast is a web-based music and podcast player designed to simulate the Spotify experience. This project was developed using HTML and CSS, featuring a sleek and modern interface that caters to music and podcast enthusiasts. With a focus on usability and aesthetics, Wavecast offers an intuitive navigation system through a side menu and showcases various media content through scrollable sections.

## Features and Application Demonstration
- **Side Navigation Menu**: Includes the Wavecast logo at the top followed by links for Home, Search, and Your Library. There are additional options for creating playlists and accessing saved podcasts.
- **Recently Played Section**: Displays cards of recently played tracks or podcasts, allowing users to quickly revisit their last sessions.
- **Podcast Specific Sections**:
  - **Hipsters Ponto Tech**: Dedicated to the Hipsters Ponto Tech podcast, this section features a horizontal scrollbar to navigate through episodes.
  - **Dev sem Fronteiras**: Similar to the Hipsters section but for the Dev sem Fronteiras podcast.
  - **Recommended for You**: Suggests a variety of podcasts based on the userâ€™s listening history, implemented with the same horizontal scrolling functionality.
- **Media Player Simulation**: At the bottom of the page, a fixed media player interface simulates playing media, complete with album art, podcast details, playback controls, and a volume slider.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the application is fully accessible and functional across all device sizes, providing an optimal experience on both desktops and mobile devices.
- **Visual Simulation Only**: Currently, the Wavecast project serves as a static prototype, showcasing the design and potential functionality of a fully interactive music and podcast player. Interactive elements such as playback controls and navigation links do not function but are intended for future development.
